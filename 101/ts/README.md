## Setup

You will need to install [NPM and node](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm). Once done, you can check they are working by running:

```
npm -v # this project was last tested on 9.5.0
node -v # this project was last tested on v19.7.0.
```

Run `npm install` to download and install the test framework used.

## Running Tests

Run `npm test` to run all tests.

## Running Linter

Run `npm run lint` to run ESLint. The `--fix` parameter is automatically passed.
